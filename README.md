## TASK 1
A console-based number guessing game is implemented in the given C++ code. The player is asked to guess a random number between 1 and 254 once it has been generated. The programme displays how many times the player has incorrectly identified the random number while giving comments on whether their guess is too high or too low.

## TASK 2
This C++ code is a simple calculator program that takes two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, or /) as input from the user and performs the corresponding mathematical operation, displaying the result. It includes error handling for division by zero and incorrect operations.

## TASK 4
This C++ code is a console-based to-do list manager that allows users to add, view, mark as completed, and remove tasks from a list. It uses a vector to store tasks, and the program provides a menu-driven interface for these operations, including error handling for invalid inputs.
